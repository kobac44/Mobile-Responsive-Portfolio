1.Portfolio.html (bootstrap)
2.Navbar development is based on the first Youtube in the "resource"
3.I used a combination of "bootstrap"and "w3schools to develop the code for the remainder of the 
"portfolio.html.
4.I found it simpler to cross reference code inputs, all codes initally found fit a specific option, 
my code isn't a new style but it's the code I found for this particular portfolio.
5.Tutuoring would be helpful to float each if the images.
6.CSS.style sheet
7.productive, but I need help understanding and identifying elements that are linked from html.
8.Grasping the concept of the border-box and floating.
9.I found useful, youtubes and stack overflow as well as w3school and bootstrap.com, 
but the searches needed left me with much needed a answer.
10.Most of these developments are the common "trial and error"
