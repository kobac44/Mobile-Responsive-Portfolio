# Mobile-Responsive-Portfolio
Bootstrap CSS Framework, for mobile responsive portfolio:
This is my personal electronic business card, to connect and extend my services to 
all public and private clients. In this portfolio there's currently 3 windows of opportunity to
research who you would hire and my qualifiable works (portfolio, about me pages) and a simple way to contact me.
Hope this page provides the potential client with what they may need.

1.Portfolio.html (bootstrap)
2.Navbar development is based on the first Youtube in the "resource"
3.I used a combination of "bootstrap"and "w3schools to develop the code for the remainder of the 
"portfolio.html.
4.I found it simpler to cross reference code inputs, all codes initally found fit a specific option, 
my code isn't a new style but it's the code I found for this particular portfolio.
5.Tutuoring would be helpful to float each if the images.
6.CSS.style sheet
7.productive, but I need help understanding and identifying elements that are linked from html.
8.Grasping the concept of the border-box and floating.

9.I found useful, youtubes and stack overflow as well as w3school and bootstrap.com, 
but the searches needed left me with much needed a answer.
10.Most of these developments are the common "trial and error"



Acceptance Criteria Requirements:
Functional, deployed application includes the following:

GitHub repository with README describing the project (for future developer review).

Navbar is consistent on each page.

Navbar on each page contains links to Home/About, Contact, and Portfolio pages.

All links work.

Semantic HTML was used for easy review.

Each page has valid and correct HTML (checked by a validation service).

Contains personalized information (bio, name, images, links to social media, etc.).

Properly utilizes Bootstrap components and grid system.

Media Queries: Media queries have not been used to provide responsiveness to ensure that individual components remained responsive during customization to even beginner developers.
